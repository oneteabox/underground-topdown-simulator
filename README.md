# underground-topdown-simulator
This is a project created to test out the best seat layout pattern for underground. 

In this little game, circles represent passengers, and blue rectangles represent underground seats. 
Click your left mouse button, passengers will be generated and go in a certain direction. 

Colours of the circle represent different mood of passengers. 
If passengers got too close with one another, or experienced collision, they become uncomfortable and angry. 
Displaying this sort of change, passenger colour would change through from green through yellow to red.
